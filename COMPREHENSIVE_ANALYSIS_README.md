- **Duplicate Handling**: The submit endpoint handles duplicates by catching database errors, but this may mask real issues

### 2. API Endpoint Inconsistencies
- **Leaderboard Data Sources**: The admin leaderboard endpoint has fallback logic to validationReports, but the public leaderboard doesn't
- **Quiz Info Endpoints**: Multiple endpoints return quiz information with different data structures
- **User ID Generation**: The generate-id endpoint has a 100-attempt limit which may fail under high load

### 3. State Management Issues
- **Admin Dashboard**: Too many useState hooks (20+) making it difficult to manage
- **Real-time Updates**: Polling-based updates may cause performance issues
- **Error Handling**: Limited error boundaries and recovery mechanisms

### 4. Security Vulnerabilities
